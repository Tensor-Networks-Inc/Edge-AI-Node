refers to (a) a company or organization (each an “Entity”) accessing the

individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on behalf
of an Entity. “Contractors” refers to your agents and contractors (including,
without limitation, outsourcers). "Program(s)" refers to Tensor Networks
software provided by Tensor Networks pursuant to this Agreement and any
updates, error corrections, and/or Program Documentation provided by
Tensor Networks. “Program Documentation” refers to Program user manuals
and Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program Documentation
may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed

terms that are specified in the Program Documentation, readmes, or notice
files and that apply to Separately Licensed Third-Party Technology.

License Rights and Restrictions Tensor Networks grants you a nonexclusive,
non-transferable, limited license to internally use the Programs, subject to the
restrictions stated in this Agreement, only for the purpose of developing,
testing, prototyping, and demonstrating your application and only if your
application has not been used for any data processing, business, commercial,
or production purposes, and not for any other purpose. You may allow your
Contractor(s) to use the Programs, provided they are acting on your behalf to
exercise license rights granted in this Agreement and further, if you are
responsible for their compliance with this Agreement in such use. You will
have a written agreement with your Contractor(s) that limits their right to use
the Programs and that otherwise protects Tensor Networks' intellectual
property rights to the same extent as this Agreement.
You may make copies of the Programs to the extent necessary to exercise the
license rights granted in this Agreement. You may make one copy of the
Programs for backup purposes.

**Further, you may not:**

- remove or modify any Program markings or any notice of Tensor
Networks or a licensor’s proprietary rights.
- make the Programs available in any manner to any third party (other
than Contractors acting on your behalf as set forth in this Agreement);
- use the Programs to provide third-party training.
- assign this Agreement or distribute, give, or transfer the Programs or
an interest in them to any third party, except as expressly permitted in
this Agreement for Contractors (the foregoing shall not be construed to
limit the rights You may otherwise have with respect to Separately
Licensed Third-Party Technology);
- cause or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for
interoperability), disassembly, or decompilation of the Programs; and
- disclose results of any Program benchmark tests without Tensor
Networks’ prior consent.

The Programs may contain source code that, unless expressly licensed in this
Agreement for other purposes (for example, licensed under an open-source
license), is provided solely for reference purposes pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and may not be modified.

All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Tensor
Networks. If you want to use the Programs or your application for any purpose
other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement, you must obtain from
Tensor Networks or a Tensor Networks reseller a valid Programs license
under a separate agreement permitting such use. However, you acknowledge
that the Programs may not be intended for production use and/or Tensor
Networks may not make a version of the Programs available for production or
other purposes; any development or other work you undertake with the
Programs is at your sole risk.

Ownership: Tensor Networks or its licensors retain all ownership and
intellectual property rights to the Programs. Third-Party Technology The
Programs may contain or require the use of third-party technology that is
provided with the Programs. Tensor Networks may provide certain notices to
you in Program Documentation, readmes, or notice files in connection with
such third-party technology. Third-party technology will be licensed to you
either under the terms of this Agreement or if specified in the Program
Documentation, readmes, or notice files, under Separate Terms.

Your rights to use Separately Licensed Third-Party Technology under
Separate Terms are not restricted in any way by this Agreement. However, for
clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a notice, third-party technology that is
not Separately Licensed Third-Party Technology shall be deemed part of the
Programs and is licensed to you under the terms of this Agreement. Source
Code for Open-Source Software For software that you receive from Tensor
Networks in binary form that is licensed under an open-source license that
gives you the right to receive the source code for that binary, you can obtain a
copy of the applicable source code by contacting Tensor Networks.

other relevant local export laws and regulations apply to the Programs. You
agree that such export control laws govern your use of the Programs

Relationship Between the Parties Tensor Networks is an independent
contractor, and we agree that no partnership, joint venture, or agency
relationship exists between us. We each will be responsible for paying our
own employees, including employment-related taxes and insurance. Nothing
in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to
independently develop or distribute software that is functionally like the other
party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not
included in such software.

Entire Agreement; Governing Law You agree that this Agreement is the
complete agreement for the Programs and this Agreement supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, including any
clickwrap, shrinkwrap, or similar licenses, or license agreements for prior
versions of the Programs. This Agreement may not be modified, and the rights
and restrictions may not be altered or waived except in writing signed by
authorized representatives of you and of Tensor Networks. If any term of this
Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
will remain effective. This Agreement is governed by the substantive and
procedural laws of the State of California, USA, and you and Tensor Networks
agree to submit to the exclusive authority of, and venue in, the courts of Santa
Clara County in California in any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement.
